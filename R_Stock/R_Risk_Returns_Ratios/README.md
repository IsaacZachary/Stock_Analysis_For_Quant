# Performance Measurement Metrics

## Description:  
### The risk-adjusted return measures the profit your investment has made relative to the amount of risk the investment has represented throughout a given period of time. If two or more investments delivered the same return over a given time period, the one that has the lowest risk will have a better risk-adjusted return.
